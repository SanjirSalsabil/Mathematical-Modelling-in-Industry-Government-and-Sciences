TITLE: **Examining the effect of contact rate and stability of SIS Epidemic model for N. Gonorrhea and SIT model for HIV transmission**

Developing mathematical models to solve real-world problems, model analysis, fitting model to data, model validation and selection, and interpretation of model outcomes. Types of models include difference equation models, differential equation models, network models, and stochastic models.


Abstract

To examine the transmission dynamics of Neisseria Gonorrhea in a heterosexual population along
with homosexual males in sexual frequency via direct contact rate. Followed by a mathematical
analysis of the SIS epidemic model presented incorporating the computation of its basic
reproduction number (R0) to clarify how fast the gonorrhea disease can be controlled or remain
endemic. In particular, for the homosexual core group, the base model extends to the exploration
of two interreacting populations which further modifies the HIV transmission model by
introducing a new feature (treatment) to develop SIT (Susceptible-Infected-Treated) model. Lastly,
advise a few control mechanisms based on the interpretation of mathematical modellings outlined
in this project to assist health professionals in order to combat gonorrhea epidemics across the
world.

Keywords: Neisseria Gonorrhea, Epidemic, Stability, Reproductive number, HIV transmission.
